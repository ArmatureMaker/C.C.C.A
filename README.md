# Clean Cutters Collection

This simple Blender script is primarily designed for Boxcutter users to help organize and clean up unused cutter objects from the 'Cutters' collection. It moves unused cutters to a separate collection named 'Unused Cutters' and assigns a red color to this new collection. And why not, it could also be useful for other users who need to manage and clean up unused objects in their Blender projects by modifiying the script.

## Features

- The script identifies which objects in the 'Cutters' collection are not used in any boolean modifiers and moves them to the 'Unused Cutters' collection.
- The 'Unused Cutters' collection is automatically assigned a red color to distinguish it from other collections.

## Usage

- Run the script directly inside Blender because if you load it as an addon it might not work.
- Access the pie menu with the `Ctrl + Alt + X` keyboard shortcut to trigger the cleaning process.

## Troubleshooting

- **Collection Not Found**: Ensure that there is a collection named 'Cutters' in your scene.
