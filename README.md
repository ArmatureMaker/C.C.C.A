# Clean Cutters Collection Addon

This simple Blender addon helps you organize and clean up unused cutter objects from the 'Cutters' collection. It moves unused cutters to a separate collection named 'Unused Cutters' and assigns a red color to this new collection for easy identification.

## Features

- The addon identifies which objects in the 'Cutters' collection are not used in any boolean modifiers and moves them to the 'Unused Cutters' collection.
- The 'Unused Cutters' collection is automatically assigned a red color to distinguish it from other collections.
- Access the pie menu with the `Ctrl + Alt + X` keyboard shortcut to trigger the cleaning process.

## Troubleshooting

- **Collection Not Found**: Ensure that there is a collection named 'Cutters' in your scene.
